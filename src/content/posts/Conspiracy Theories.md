# Jacobs Ladder
What happened to Mike Markham the guy that built a time travel machine and then disappeared 1995.
This guy Mike Markham was playing around building machine called a Jacob's Ladder looks like it's essentially two 
metal rods with a spark going between. Them but after he built it a Vortex on the small machine. Appear at the top 
Mike then put a screw through it and the screw actually disappeared and reappeared a few seconds later. 
 
On scale to make one that was a lot bigger the promise to get enough power to do so is going to be very expensive. 
He went to a local city Transformers electric park claiming that he needed a 20,000 bolts of electricity To power this. 
He went to the Transformers he plugged in his machine and said he caused the city white blackout. 
 
Police then came shortly after and arrested him and the judge put him in jail for 2 months. This guy named Art Bell 
finds out about the story and invites him onto his radio show and comes on the show to talk about his experience.

Talks about what he was doing and it blows up as the audience is going crazy asking him questions. Mike is answering 
every single question finding the live recordings of these are all posts online is over his whole story. About how 
he's just trying to build a fancy Jacob's Ladder and accidentally built the time travel machine.

And art asked him if he did go into the future what would he bring and which might answer. He would only bring a 
cell phone with him So he blew up people donating electric parts money. He had hundreds of thousands of dollars 
worth of electric parts to fund his next project machine.

If he was building one a few years later after the story, art decides to reach out to Mike like what's he up to. 
Calls all of his old connections that he reached out to to get Mike in the first place. You know parents, family, 
and nobody has seen him so he gets in touch with one of Mike’s old friends.

Friend told art that Mike was building one last machine for one last experiment in which Mike would actually be 
going through the Vortex. The story ends there but there is one weird coincidence that happened afterwards. When 
they were looking at old arrest records and police reports.

To see if there’s any coincidences a California beach in the 1930s the police found a giant strange metal tube.
 With a man crushed inside the tube the man was unrecognizable. They found a strange mysterious technological device.

He did mention that if he did time travel he would only bring a cell phone so a lot of people were predicting 
that he actually died in the 1930s. Went back in time but it’s a very curious case of time travel.

# Jack the Ripper 
Did this man solve the mystery of jack the ripper?
In 2014 and after 30 years of research swdish journalist Christer Holmgren name Charles Allen Lechmere as the only 
plausible suspect in the Jack the Ripper case.

What evidence did he have? Well circumstantial at best criminologists have looked into Lecmere's early life and found 
similar patterns to those of many known serial killers. He came from a broken home his father abandoned his family when 
Lecmere was young. He moved around a lot his route to work from home took him through the area where all five victims were found.

He was first on the scene of Marianne Nichols murder. He gave a false name of Charles Cross to the inquest and only 
attended when he was called out in the newspaper as being present at the time.He was never charged and died in 1920 
at the age of 71.

**Other suspect**

The theory is Ghandi is not who he claimed to be. 

Ghandi came to London in 1888. Jack the Ripper started his killing spree in 1888. Ghandi returned to India in 1891 
Jacks supposed last murder was in 1891. Jacks identity was never found out.
