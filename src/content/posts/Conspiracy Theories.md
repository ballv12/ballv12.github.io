# Jacobs Ladder
In 1995 Mike Mccrum wasn't lying...

He made this thing called a Jacobs ladder and found if he threw metal through it, it would disappear and reappear somewhere else so..

He decided he wanted to make a bigger one he could walk through but ended up using all the power in the city...
He ended up getting arrested and then..

He was interviewed and asked if it worked what would he bring. He said "just my cellphone" and..
A month later after he went missing a huge barrel washed up. All that was found was a cellphone.

# Jack the Ripper 
Did this man solve the mystery of jack the ripper?
In 2014 and after 30 years of research swdish journalist Christer Holmgren name Charles Allen Lechmere as the only 
plausible suspect in the Jack the Ripper case.

What evidence did he have? Well circumstantial at best criminologists have looked into Lecmere's early life and found similar patterns to those of many known serial killers. 

He came from a broken home his father abandoned his family when Lecmere was young. He moved around a lot his route to work from home took him through the area where all five victims were found.

He was first on the scene of Marianne Nichols murder. He gave a false name of Charles Cross to the inquest and only attended when he was called out in the newspaper as being present at the time.

He was never charged and died in 1920 at the age of 71.

**Other suspect**
The theory is Ghandi is not who he claimed to be. 

Ghandi came to London in 1888. Jack the Ripper started his killing spree in 1888. Ghandi returned to India in 1891 Jacks supposed last murder was in 1891. Jacks identity was never found out.
