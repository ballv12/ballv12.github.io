According to Bloomberg, Roblox Corporation is currently part of an "ongoing investigation" by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The details of this investigation are currently unknown as both Roblox and the SEC declined to comment.

Context: The SEC is a government agency whose primary purpose is to enforce laws against market manipulation.

In October, the now-defunct short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report on child-safety concerns at Roblox and also alleged that the company had inflated its metrics, including the number of users who regularly play Roblox games and the amount of time they spend on average on the platform.

Hunterbrook Media reported in November that Roblox was under investigation by the SEC, citing Freedom of Information Act requests.
