# Roblox puts its virtual currency to the test in real-world lawsuit against online reseller site
LAWSUIT FILED Tuesday in federal court in San Francisco against the PlayerAuctions gaming marketplace may provide the answer to an important question for online gamers.

Gamers know that the assets they acquire as they play — the game’s “currency” and the virtual assets like clothing or tools that they earn or purchase along the way — have real value, but how can they take advantage of it? Do they have to spend it on the platform where they got it, or can they sell it to someone else? Roblox’s suit focuses on a “virtual currency” called “Robux” and other virtual assets earned by players of Roblox games when they are playing the games.

Roblox is no fan of its gamers selling their Roblox assets on the exchange, and presumably in the hope of blocking that, Roblox’s suit claims that by using the names “Roblox” and “Robux” on the exchange’s website, PlayerAuctions is infringing Roblox’ trademarks and diluting their value.
