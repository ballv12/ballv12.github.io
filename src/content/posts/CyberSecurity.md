# DOGE Staffer Previously Fired From Cybersecurity Company for Leaking Secrets

The teen went by Big Balls online.

Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old member of Elon Muskâ€™s DOGE, was fired from his previous job at a cybersecurity company for leaking company secrets, according to a new report from Bloomberg News. Coristine was an intern at Arizona-based Path Network in 2022 when he was fired for allegedly sharing information about the company with a competing company.

The DOGE team was assembled by Musk to supposedly look for ways to battle waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government, all with the blessing of President Donald Trump, but the reality is much darker. The DOGE soldiers have been ransacking every agency they touch, gaining access to private information and the kinds of things that a foreign adversary would love to get their hands on.
