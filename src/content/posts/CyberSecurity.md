## Federal judge blocks Elon Musk’s DOGE access to critical Treasury payment system

The judge’s order, issued early Saturday, temporarily halts access to a sensitive payment system

## PlayStation Network outage live updates – PSN is back after a massive disruption

A PlayStation Network outage is exactly what you don't need on a weekend, but it's unfortunately what we had for over 24 hours.

Frustrated PS5 and PS4 gamers first reported problems accessing PSN at around 6pm ET on Friday (February 7), and it wasn't until 6:58pm ET on Saturday (February 8) that service was restored.

PlayStation has just posted that "PSN has been restored." on the @AskPlayStation account on X (formerly Twitter). Additionally, the post points folks to the official status page that now reads, "All services are up and running."

You should be able to access online features without any problems now. For more details: https://status.playstation.com Sorry for the inconvenience!"
