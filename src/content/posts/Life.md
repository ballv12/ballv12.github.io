# My life sucks
On Jan 14, 2025 I lost my gold chain. It takes place at home and school.

*How did I lost my gold chain??*
I woke up a bit late 7:20 something I got my choltes and towel to take a shower.
I go to my parnts restroom to take a shower. I come out the shower fast as I can I chagne to get ready for school. I remember well to I would always say that I would wear my chain to school.

I was runing late my mom was waiting for me outside in the car I though about taking my chain I take and put in my pocket I come out runing out my room while putting on my shoes.

I hope in the car fast as I can i'm checking my pockets for my chain if I still have it. We drop off my sister for school like always after that my mom drops me to my school.

When we arrive I come out the car and check my pockets for my airpods and chain. I still have it I go to my first per. I'm in class doing my work I think to myself why didn't I put it on in class??? Anyways After the first per ended I got my stuff I walked out the class and then I check my pockets.

For my chain it was still there I kept walking to get breskfest I had my hands in my pocket. I take out my hand out of my pocket I didn't notctes I droped my chain. I walked a bit more I check again It wasn't there I look back all scared.

I tell my friend who was next to me I tell him lets go back I lost my chain. We go back looking around for it I still can't find it. I tell my other friend about it he starts to look for it to it was getting late I had to go to class.

My firend stays looking for it I tell him it's gold and to text me if he finds it. I go to class I text him in class telling him if he found it. He says he didn't find I was all sad I really like it I only got to wear it once.
