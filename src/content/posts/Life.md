# My life sucks
On Jan 14, 2025 I lost my gold chain. It takes place at home and school.

*How did I lost my gold chain??*
I woke up a bit late 7:20 something I got my choltes and towel to take a shower.
I go to my parnts restroom to take a shower. I come out the shower fast as I can I chagne to get ready for school. I remember well to I would always say that I would wear my chain to school.

I was runing late my mom was waiting for me outside in the car I though about taking my chain I take and put in my pocket I come out runing out my room while putting on my shoes.

I hope in the car fast as I can i'm checking my pockets for my chain if I still have it. We drop off my sister for school like always after that my mom drops me to my school.

When we arrive I come out the car and check my pockets for my airpods and chain. I still have it I go to my first per. I'm in class doing my work I think to myself why didn't I put it on in class??? Anyways After the first per ended I got my stuff I walked out the class and then I check my pockets.

For my chain it was still there I kept walking to get breskfest I had my hands in my pocket. I take out my hand out of my pocket I didn't notctes I droped my chain. I walked a bit more I check again It wasn't there I look back all scared. *Time: 9:56 am*

I tell my friend who was next to me I tell him lets go back I lost my chain. We go back looking around for it I still can't find it. I tell my other friend about it he starts to look for it to it was getting late I had to go to class.

My firend stays looking for it I tell him it's gold and to text me if he finds it. I go to class I text him in class telling him if he found it. He says he didn't find I was all sad I really like it I only got to wear it once.

When it was per 4 I was thinking about it the whole time. I got up out of seat at 3:04 pm I told the teacher that I wanted to go to the guide office to ask about my chain. She said 'oh go after school' I said ok I was sad and overthinking hoping they will return back to me. By leaving at the guide office.

My other friend said what I lost I told him I lost my chain and showed him a picture of it. He took a picture with his phone he said he will try to find it to.

After school I went to the guide office to see if anyone droped off my chain. The front desk lady said no hasn't came she ask everone if anyone came to drop off a chain. They all said no I said ok and left.

It's been a month now and my dad found that I lost the chain. He thinks I sold it or gave it away orr someone took it from. He got so mad that he was about to break my macbook but he just close it hard.

He kept saying to tell him the true I told him the true that I lost it he still doesn't belive me. He said he if he should break my macbook or sell it. I told him to sell it he told me to delete off it so I did. I took all my picture put in a folder and send it to the flash drive.

He left the house to his car cause he was so mad. He came back to the houes he said again to tell him the true but I already did he just doesn't belive me. 10pm my mom comes home my dad tell my mom that I have news to tell her.

I tell her the true to she doesn't belive me I'm heart broken because even my doesn't belive. They start to talk about the chain how good it looks and they been holding on to it for years sicne I was a little kid.

And now it's gone my dad saying they are not going to trust me any more. They took away my room, laptop, and they saying they going to take away my own money that I work for. All of this story I told my gf we texting on the school laptop telling her everyone.

On if should I run away from home she said I can't because i'm not 18 the cops will bring me back. This whole time I been thinking on what to do I was thinking on trying to find a job save money to buy a place to stay.

I'm tried of this place they always get mad at me it drives me crazy. They mess me up bad that I think no wants me I should die. I talk to god to take me away already i'm tried of living I can't anymore. I lost my brother and sister they were so young I say that I was a bad brother.

Anyways I went to my room to get some of my stuff to sleep and take a shower. I'm sleeping at my parnts room on the floor. I have a hard time sleeping the floor is hard and I wake up with my body hurting.
